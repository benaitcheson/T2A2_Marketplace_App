## About the Project

This application was designed to make financial planning costs more competitive so the customer has better access to professional financial advice. Each planner registers their Australian Financial Services Licence (AFSL) and their background while each customer registers and completes the fact finder so that a planner can choose which client can receive the appropriate advice.
